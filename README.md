# LLM Red-Team Kit

**Author:** Grimaldi Roberto | AI Ethics  
Automated adversarial testing (prompt injection/jailbreak) for LLM-enabled workflows.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Logical Steps
1. Define threat model (fraud, PII leakage, jailbreak).
2. Build attack corpus (injection, indirect injection, exfil).
3. Run automated tests against chosen LLM endpoints.
4. Log attack success/failure and severity.
5. Add guardrails (filters, policies); re-test to threshold.
6. Create abuse-response runbook.
7. Schedule monthly red-team exercises.
8. Keep audit trail for each test run.

## KPIs
- Business: Incident rate ↓; MTTR ↓.
- Ethics: Harmful outputs → near zero.
- Compliance: Complete audit log per release.
